# Transformer

This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer, closely following the original paper, "Attention Is All You Need."

The implementation is located in the src directory, and the tests for each module are in the test folder.

I followed the TDD methodology to build this project, aiming to make the code as understandable as possible.
